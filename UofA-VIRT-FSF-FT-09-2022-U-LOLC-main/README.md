# Full-Stack Course Overview

Welcome to the Full-Stack Boot Camp! Some of the most important factors that influence how well and how quickly you learn something are not only how you structure and sequence your learning, but also how you stay motivated and curious about the material, and how you leverage your prior knowledge to build new knowledge you can apply in different situations. 

Learning how to become a web developer is not easy. It will take a lot of internal drive and outside support. To make that journey a bit easier, the course curriculum is structured and sequenced to keep motivation high and connections between concepts clear. 

The course is broken down into three phases, with a group project at the end of each. Let's delve into what each phase covers and what you'll create during the project weeks. 

## What to Expect in Phase 1 

The first third of the course focuses on the front end&mdash;the words, images, and forms you see and interact with in the browser&mdash;like when you click a login button and a dialog box pops up. Front-end languages, techniques, and libraries are foundational to being a full-stack developer, and you’ll continue to build on these skills throughout the course.

## Project 1

This boot camp will be taxing, and having something you can look back on and be proud of early in the course helps keep motivation and morale high. You might not believe it now, but it’s totally possible to build a cool interactive web application after the first few weeks by developing the front-end yourself and leveraging other people’s servers and APIs. For example, Food Finder is a student-made app that helps you find recipes. Fourth and Lawn is another student-made app that helps you find parking at sporting events.

## What to Expect in Phase 2 

You could stop here and look for jobs as a front-end web developer, but the field demands more. There are a plethora of opportunities for developers who can build their own back end. In the second phase, you will learn to build your own server code. 

As mentioned earlier, the second factor influencing how strong and quickly you learn something new is how you are able to take what you already know and make helpful connections with new material in order to develop a solid understanding of new concepts. Having a back end allows us to use a server to make and receive requests from the front end. An example of this is if a user clicks a login button, fills out their user information in the dialog box, and clicks submit, those credentials could be validated via a back-end server.

## Project 2

As a final project for the second phase, you'll combine your ability to create a front-end website with your new ability to write server code to create a site that interacts with your server code. Starting your second project from scratch instead of using the front end you developed in Project 1 helps reinforce your existing front-end abilities and solidify how you conceive of the front-end and back-end dynamic. If your front-end fundamentals are not strong at the end of the first project, you'll be building on a weak foundation. 

## What to Expect in Phase 3 

The third phase primarily focuses on React and computer science fundamentals. React is a popular front-end advanced library that has taken off over the last few years. Why do we go back to the front-end at the very end? Well, unlike JQuery, React brings a certain level of abstraction that is harder to grasp without a working understanding of the back end. React will allow for us to create highly reusable components. Instead of having to create the same element multiple times, React allows us to create it once, and render it as many times as necessary for our application. We can even dynamically render these components to populate information as needed, and not take up more memory than necessary.

We’ll also cover computer science fundamentals, which are essential to web development. Our curriculum includes a deep dive into the basics of coding and algorithms. While this content is no replacement for a computer science degree, you will learn what you need to know to work efficiently and create optimized code. Practices such as sorting algorithms and Big O notation are very important to code efficiency, and will be something you think about when writing applications throughout your career.

## Project 3

As a capstone to the boot camp, you’ll work in groups to build novel full-stack applications that solve real-world problems and use a wide swath of the languages and libraries you learned over the course of these past few months. We can’t wait to see what you build!

# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!).  Thank you to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Suggestions for a good README
Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

## Name
Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
